# Viewing logs
{: #view_logs}

After you provision an instance of the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, and configure a LogDNA agent for a log source, you can view, monitor, and manage log data through the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA Web UI.
{:shortdesc}

When you launch the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA Web UI, log entries are displayed with a predefined format. You can modify in the **User Preferences** section how the information in each log line is displayed. You can also filter logs and modify search settings, then bookmark the result as a *view*. You can attach and detach one or more alerts to a view. You can define a custom format for how your lines are shown in the view. You can expand a log line and see the data parsed.


Complete the following steps to view logs:


## Step 1: Grant IAM policies to a user to view logs
{: #view_logs_step1}

**Note:** You must be an adminsitrator of the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service, an administrator of the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance, or have account IAM permissions to grant other users policies.

The following table lists the minimum policies that a user must have to be able to launch the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA Web UI, and view logs:

| Service                        | Role                      | Permission granted                                                                            |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  | `IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA` | Platform role: Viewer     | Allows the user to view the list of service instances in the Observability Logging dashboard. |
| `IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA` | Service role: Reader      | Allows the user to launch the Web UI and view logs in the Web UI.                             |
{: caption="Table 1. IAM policies" caption-side="top"} 

For more information on how to configure these policies for a user, see [Granting permissions to a user to view logs in LogDNA](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-work_iam#user_logdna).


## Step 2: Launch the Web UI through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI
{: #view_logs_step2}

To launch IBM the Log Analysis with LogDNA UI through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.

    The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard can be found at: [http://bluemix.net ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix.net){:new_window}.

	After you log in with your user ID and password, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard opens.

2. In the navigation menu, select **Observability**. 

3. Select **Logging**. 

    The list of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instances that are available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is displayed.

4. Select one instance. Then, click **View LogDNA**.

The IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA Web UI opens and displays logs forwarded to that instance.


## Step 3: Customize your default view
{: #view_logs_step3}

In the **USER PREFERENCES** section, you can modify the order of the data fields that are displayed per line.

Complete the following steps to modify the format of a log line:

1. Select the **Configuration** icon ![Configuration icon](images/admin.png "Admin icon").
2. Select **USER PREFERENCES**. A new window opens.
3. Select **Log Format**.
4. Modify the *Line Format* section to match your requirements. Drag boxes.


## Step 4: Look into a log line
{: #view_logs_step4}

At any time, you can view each log line in context.

Complete the following steps: 

1. Click the **Views** icon ![Configuration icon](images/views.png "Configuration icon").
2. Select **Everything** or a view.
3. Identify a line in the log that you want to explore.
4. Expand the log line. 

    Information about line identifiers, tags, and labels is displayed.

5. Click **View in Context** to see the log line in context of other log lines from that host, app, or both.

6. Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the message field to the clipboard.

When you are finished, close the line.


## Step 5: Filter logs
{: #view_logs_step5}

You can filter logs by log source, application, and log level. 

* A source can be a host, a computer, a virtual machine, or a Heroku app.
* An application represents a log file, a program, or a container.
* Examples of log levels are: INFO, DEBUG, ERROR

Complete the following steps to filter logs:

1. Click the **Views** icon ![Configuration icon](images/views.png "Configuration icon").
2. Select **Everything** or a view.
3. Expand **All Tags** to see the list of tags that are identified in the logs. Then, choose the ones that you want.
4. Expand **All Sources** to see the list of log sources that are identified in the logs. Then, choose the ones that you want.
5. Expand **All Apps** to see the list of apps that are identified in the logs. Then, choose the ones that you want.
6. Expand **All Levels** to see the list of log levels that are identified in the logs. Then, choose the ones that you want.


**Note:** In each section, you can group multiple options into a group. Group tags, log sources, apps, and log levels to reuse these groupings when you filter log data in other custom views.

To create a group, select multiple values. Then, click **Save as group**. Enter a name for the group, and save it.


## Step 6: Search logs
{: #view_logs_step6}

When you search log data, the search applies any log filters and time queries configured in that view.

You can do simple searches (single term string search), compound search (multiple search terms and operators), field searches if the log line can be parsed, and others. For more information, see [How to Search Logs in LogDNA docs ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/search){:new_window}.

**Note:** AND and OR operators are case-sensitive and must be capitalized.



## Step 7: Create views
{: #view_logs_step7}
